please generate a mood based recipe reccomendation app. I want the user to select their mood 
and then get a recipe based on that mood shown to them. They should be able to request 
a new recipe if they dont like that one.

I want to make this as simple as possible. Please use express for the backend, sqlite 
for storing the recipes and javascript, html and css with tailwind for the frontend.
